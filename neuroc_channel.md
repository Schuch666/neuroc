This collection highlights [Neuroconductor](https://neuroconductor.org) package-based vignettes, cross-package workflows that guide users through tasks in medical nueroimaging, including data organization, processing, and inferential analysis.  Neuroconductor is an open-source platform for rapid testing and dissemination of reproducible computational imaging software.  The goals of the project are to: 1) provide a centralized repository of R software dedicated to image analysis, 2) disseminate software updates quickly, 3) train a large, diverse community of scientists using detailed tutorials and short courses, 4) increase software quality via automatic and manual quality controls, and 5) promote reproducibility of image data analysis.
