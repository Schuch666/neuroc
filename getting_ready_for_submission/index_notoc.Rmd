# Startup Process

Most of the work we will cover here will get you up and running for submission to our GitHub-based platform.  We will use the devtools package to help us with the process of package development.  If you do not have the package installed, please run:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
```

After `devtools` is installed, you should go through the following process:

1.  Setting up Git
2.  Using GitHub
3.  Creating a `README.md` file
4.  Setting up continuous integration: Travis CI and Appveyor
5.  Creating a Vignette
6.  Creating Unit Tests using `testthat`
7.  Using Code Coverage
8.  Checking your package
9.  Submitting your package to our platform

# Version Control using Git 

We will use the [`git` version control system](https://git-scm.com/) for our repositories.  Other version control systems exist, such as Subversion and Mercurial, but we require `git` for our packages as this is the most popular modern version control system.

## Setting up Git

### RStudio 
If you use `RStudio` to set up your packages, please check "Create a git repository" when setting up your package.  Once a repository is set up, you can use the `Tools → Version Control` menu in RStudio for committing and pushing if you do not want to use the command line.

### Using `devtools`

In `R`, you can use `devtools` to set up the `git` repository.  If you are in the root directory of the package (the place with `DESCRIPTION`, `NAMESPACE`, etc. files), you can run:

```r
devtools::use_git()
```

If you would like to pass in the path of the directory instead, use:

```r
devtools::use_git(pkg = "/path/to/repository")
```

Now you should have a folder on your machine (it may be hidden) that stores your commits and changes.

# Hosting Git Repositories GitHub 

Our platform is based on [GitHub](https://github.com/), which is an online server of the to host `git` repositories.  There are other online repositories for `git`, such as [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com).  Although hosting on these repositories should be valid, we currently require all developers to currently host on GitHub.  GitHub is the most popular platform in our experience and all hooks/backend development we use is based on that.  Note, `git` is a system/software, usually installed on your machine, and GitHub is the online server hosting it.  In order to host your repository on GitHub, you must sign up for an account at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/). 

## Setting up GitHub 

### Using the GitHub Website 
In order to set up your repository for GitHub, you can either use the website.  When you are logged into Github, click the plus sign in the top right hand corner <img src="plus.png" style="display: inline; width: 5%">, and then click "New Repository" In the top right hand corner.  We **highly** recommend naming the GitHub repository the same name as the package.

### Using `devtools`

Using `devtools`, you can use the `use_github`.  In order to use this command, you must have a personal access token (PAT) from https://github.com/settings/tokens. Make sure at least the `public_repo` option is checked.  If you have a token set in the `GITHUB_PAT` environment variable, `devtools` will use that.  

If you do not have the `GITHUB_PAT` environment variable set, you must specify `auth_token = "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"` in the following commands.


If you are in the root directory of the package (the place with `DESCRIPTION`, `NAMESPACE`, etc. files), you can run:

```r
devtools::use_github()
```

If you would like to pass in the path of the directory instead, use:

```r
devtools::use_git(pkg = "/path/to/repository")
```

Check the GitHub website to ensure you have set up your GitHub repository.  You should be able to see the "Push" button enabled when you go to `Tools → Version Control → Commit` in RStudio.


### GitHub Links in your `DESCRIPTION` file

Now that you have GitHub enabled, run:

```r
devtools::use_github_links()
```

so that your "Issues" and "URL" fields are set in `DESCRIPTION` to the GitHub link.

# Setting Up a README file

Once you have your package set up, you

```r
devtools::use_travis()
```




# Session Info


```r
devtools::session_info()
